# AI meldoy generator using Evolutionary Algorithms

## Description
This project is a simple AI melody generator using evolutionary algorithms. The AI just tries to generate similar melody given to the input audio file using a simple fitness function. Although better outputs can be achieved using more complex fitness functions like NNs to evaluate the fitness of the generated melody.

## Examples
<!-- play an sample audio file -->
<div align="center" style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">

</div>
The first audio sample is the input audio file and the audio sample at the bottom is the generated melody.
